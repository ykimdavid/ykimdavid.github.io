title: Dopamine Detox
---
Imagine being so bored from stimulation that you want to experience the nostalgia of that good old, *classic* boredom of early childhood. The kind where you just stared at the ceiling lost in thought while time drifted along in slow motion. That was me. Fresh off the back of a weeks-long, finals-induced stimulant binge, my mental state was on the verge of disaster. I was exhausted and disillusioned by the past month of listlessness that scientists will soon discover is a primary symptom of a Zoom-based college experience. Perhaps it was that additional layer of artificiality that broke me, but I had a desperate desire to return to a more natural way of life.

I briefly flirted with the idea of renting out an Airbnb and doing an impromptu silent retreat, but decided against it in light of the coronavirus. I figured I can just try it at home first. So after my last final on Thursday, I turned off all of my devices, abandoned them on my desk, and moved my mattress into the guest room. I was to spend the next three days there, alone with my kindle, a notebook, and my thoughts in a self-imposed “Dopamine Detox”.

I tried my best to go into the experience without any expectations. I didn’t want to give myself undue stress trying to get anything out of the experience; I just wanted to see what would happen. Regardless, I did have some questions going into it. What would happen, I wondered, if I were to strip away all the obligations and expectations that I had acquired over time? Surely these things that now occupy most of my conscious thoughts have suppressed some other vital parts of my personality and being, if only to make space for themselves. There was no more perfect time than now for this experiment: the conclusion of finals and the extension of quarantine ensured that I had neither academic nor social obligations to worry about.

<h4>My Experience</h4>

The first day, like all of the days, was uneventful. It did feel very rejuvenating doing nothing. I spent a couple hours on my couch, looking out the window and trying to *relax*<sup>TM</sup>. At first, it felt a little forced and unnatural. Even in isolation, I felt guilty that my mind was not focused on something, so I would study the trees and mountains. But as the hours went by, I let my mind do as it pleased. It felt good just to stare into space. 

I slept for a lot of the day, which I suspect was a result of both boredom and accumulated fatigue. Without any obligations, the formula for rest was refreshingly simple: are you tired? Then sleep until you’re not.

I spent much of the next day reading and journaling. I wrote about my tenuous relationship with my parents, my fixation with the approval of others, and other personal topics that I had long wanted to write about but didn’t feel I had the necessary time or mental bandwidth to do. Being able to dedicate my complete attention to these tasks was enlightening and therapeutic.

When writing became too difficult, I gravitated towards my kindle. The books that I read lent themselves to my very self-reflective mood -- I read Letters to a Young Poet, Steppenwolf, and Faust (that they were all written German books was entirely a coincidence). With an absence of anything to do, reading was a much-needed escape from my own mind. However, it isn’t lost on me that books served essentially the same role as my phone, in this sense. I wonder how a future dopamine detox would be without having even this outlet of distraction.
After around 36 hours in isolation and intermittent naps, the days began to feel longer and more hopeful. I was able to get in touch with old, nostalgic feelings of days where I had nothing to do, and no urge to do anything about that. Liberated from all the burdens of stress and anxiety that I normally subject it to, my mind had a newfound clarity and freshness. I remember being really grateful that I lived in such a quiet neighborhood where I can listen to the birds sing in the morning. 

It was during this time that I also began to lean into deeper musings. I spent the night wrestling with feelings of existential loneliness, something that I had distracted myself from for years. Giving it my full attention, and pondering God, destiny, and self-reliance felt like I was exercising a spiritual muscle long atrophied by daily life, irony, and cynicism. I might write another blog post on this topic some other time.

Funnily enough, by the last day I had no real desire to stop. The anxieties about all the notifications and messages I was missing at the beginning of this experiment were no longer there. I felt in control of myself, for the first time in a while.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>

I’ve felt some very real benefits from this brief experiment. Here are a couple realizations I made, listed medium-style.

***Rest is a critical foundation to mental health.*** I had more rest during these three days than I had during the past month. I caught up on sleep, but also having dedicated time for your mind to be free from anxious and obsessive thoughts is just as important. I came out of the retreat feeling refreshed, grounded, and optimistic. Taking the time to take care of your brain in this way sets a necessary foundation for personal growth. It’s virtually impossible to practice conscious living when you’re stressed and exhausted. 

***Compassion and understanding are necessary to change “bad” habits.*** Allowing myself to take a deeper look at my personal problems helped me better understand the motivations underlying my complexes and bad habits. For example, this detox helped me realize the role that distractions play in my life. For most of my life, distractions were simply bad because they were distractions; they distracted me from being productive. But they also distracted me from dealing with the emotions that underlie this distracted behavior. Why am I binging Youtube videos when I should normally be tired? At what point am I compelled to check my Facebook? What is the discomfort that I am trying to palliate through distraction?

Now, I can address the anxiety that underlies all of this compulsive behavior. If I just resolved to stop watching Youtube or deactivate my Facebook, like I have countless times before, I’d inevitably relapse into old habits because the underlying problem was not treated. These non-foundational resolutions aren’t just unproductive; they reinforce patterns of guilt and self-loathing. Now, my behavioral changes are no longer driven by guilt and some artificial standard of productivity; I stopped binge-watching Youtube videos not because it was “wrong” or “unproductive”, but because I became more adept at compassionately addressing with the underlying anxieties and feelings that prompted me to distract my mind.

***My current paradigm for work was flawed.*** As a generally distracted person, I allowed the corpus of digital entertainment to encroach upon my life and obligations, to the point that work was the unwelcome distraction in a life of shallow pleasures.

When left alone without these distractions, I had two choices: do something or do nothing. Both choices were equally fine -- as a distracted person, I had little experience in either. But after enough time sitting with an empty head, I was inspired to do. This, I feel, is the human condition. Whatever work I then chose to do, was now entirely of my own volition and pursued only for my satisfaction. Rather than seek distraction for pleasure, I now had to work for pleasure. And thus, my relationship with pleasure changes -- I no longer operate at a baseline state of stimulation, but at a calmer equilibrium. I must go to work for my satisfaction and pleasure, which is derived entirely from the work itself.

I think this ties in well with my recent conclusions regarding consuming versus creation. The detox revealed a fundamental human desire to create that had long been suppressed by excessive consumption. There’s no doubt in my mind why artists often take retreats to their remote homes in search of creative inspiration. It is this creative impetus, I believe, that I am in the process of rediscovering.
