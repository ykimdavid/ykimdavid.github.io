In a fit of inspiration, I finally set up my personal website and blog. Setting this up proved to be a decent distraction from the existential dread that has haunted me over the past couple weeks of quarantine, so I plan on continuing this blog for as long as it proves effective.

In all seriousness, I find that there's a lot of joy to be found in creating things, no matter how shitty these things are. I think I've always known this, but this truth was recently reaffirmed to me when I decided to attend a virtual design workshop over the weekend, producing these beauties:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/dumbfuckjuice.png) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50%" -->
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/AngryWomanCatMeme.png)

Despite the lack of quality, it was really enjoyable to not only learn a new skill but to actually apply it and make something I can call my own. Like most people, most of my interactions with media are from the perspective of a consumer -- I consume movies, art, music, videos, articles. Maybe it's just the novelty of this feeling of creation that's so attractive, but in any case, it does feel more rewarding. I aim to make this blog a place where I can dump all kinds of shit I come up with during this quarantine (blog posts, art, essays, songs) without any anxieties about putting out my best work. I'm really good at half-assing things, and I think it's time to start using that to my advantage.
